            Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand

            My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for
            design. Colors, typography, layout and the whole package.

            I started my design journey with motion design in my college days.
            Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the
            flexibility of story telling.

            Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography
            really makes you look and percieve things in a different way.
